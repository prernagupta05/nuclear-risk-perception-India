Before fitting a linear regression model, I conducted factor analysis on the Kahan scale and the newly developed economic-political value scale. The results from the Factor Analysis are below. 

The Individualism items (indicated by K_I) were bringing down the cronbach's alpha values in the Kahan scale. The Alpha for INdividualism- Communitarian scale was 0.49. After removing the Individualism items (K_I) the alpha for this factor was 0.71. The reasons for this could be that the individualism items are not well adapted to the Indian population. 

I conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the  Kahan scale (see Appendix 1) since this a well used scale with theoretical basis for factor distinctions and also previous studies have used this scale.  

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Q6: Does the Kahan scale explain perception of risk from nuclear energy and other DVs ? 

# we conducted fa on the kahan scale 
# CFA for Kahan scale. We shouldn't do FA here since this a well used scale with theoretical basis for factor distinctions and also previous studies using the same scale

RMSEA - between 0.05 and 0.08 (reasonable fit), less than 0.05 close fit and greater than 0.10 is poor fit 
CFI - greater than 0.90 or 0.95 indicates good fit
TFI - CFI>TFI >0.90 - indicates good fit


After having removed a few variables that had very low loading, the model is now a good fit. Some of the Individualistic variables just don't fit. Final scale variables:

KahanH(Hierarchy- Egalitarian) =K_HEQUAL+ K_ERADEQ1 + K_EWEALTH + K_ERADEQ2

The Cronabch alpha for this final scale was 0.75.

# Factor Analysis: New Eco-political Scale

Then I conducted Factor Analysis on all eco-political values(see Appendix 2). The Cronbach's alpha for the scale was high at 0.785 (almost 0.8). 

The scale reduced to two factors which I named as 1) People Centered Development and 2) Nationalist Development.
The final scale with two factors include the following 

**MR1 People Centered Development: Pdevelop**

HEALTHNUCLEAR	-  Nuclear energy poses a great risk to the health of people living around it.

BEAUTYNUCLEAR	-  Nuclear energy spoils the natural beauty of the landscape.

MECHANISATION	-  Rapid mechanization of work is taking away jobs from workers in this country.

INDUSTRYSMALL	-  Large corporations are destroying the local industries in India and benefiting only a handful of people.

DISPLACENUCLEAR- Nuclear energy is leading to displacement of people from their land.

POLLUTENUCLEAR-  Nuclear energy increases pollution of air/water/land. 

OWNERREG-        Regardless of ownership, the government should pass strong regulations and implement them.


**MR2 Nationalist Development: Ndevelop**

DEVNUCLEAR	-  Nuclear energy pushes forward the country's development.

PRIDENUCLEAR-  I would be proud if my community used nuclear energy.

NPRIDENUCLEAR- Nuclear energy is a mark of pride for our nation.

PROSPERNUCLEAR-Nuclear energy brings economic prosperity to the surrounding regions.

INDUSTRYLARGE- Large scale industries are required for the development of the country that will benefit everyone.

Key observations:


**1. Demographic effects:** The impact of demographic characteristics on the perceived risk from Nuclear Energy appears to be small. The adjusted R-squared of the first model, which includes only demographic variables, is 0.023, indicating that these variables explain just over 2% of the variance in perceived risk.

**2. Age effects:** In Model 2, where age groups are added, there is a distinct change in the perceived risk from nuclear energy as age increases. Interestingly, only the age group 65-74 shows a significant increase in perceived risk, compared to the reference age group (18-25 years). 

**3. Gender effects:** In the initial model, being male is positively associated with higher perceived risk from nuclear energy. However, the significance of this association diminishes when age and state variables are included in the model, suggesting that the relationship between gender and perceived risk may be influenced by these factors.

**4. State effects:** Both exploratory visualizations and regression models strongly suggest that the respondents' state of residence significantly influences their perceived risk from nuclear energy. The comparison state is Maharashtra. The coefficients for the other states can be interpreted as the difference in perceived risk from each state compared to Maharashtra, holding all else constant.

**5. Kahan scale effects:** Among the Kahan scale variables, only the individualism factor is statistically significant in the third model. This suggests that individuals scoring high on the individualism scale perceive nuclear energy as less risky.

**6. Eco-political scale effects:** When we introduce the eco-political scale, the effect of the individualism factor from the Kahan scale loses its significance. This could suggest that the eco-political scale is capturing some aspect of the risk perception related to individualism. The two factors of the eco-political scale both have a statistically significant impact on the perceived risk, indicating that these eco-political beliefs play an important role in shaping risk perceptions.
