Individualism - Communitarinism

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{K\_IINTRFER} The government interferes far too much in our
  everyday lives.
\item
  \textbf{K\_IPRIVACY} The government should stop telling people how to
  live their lives.
\item
  \textbf{K\_IPROTECT} It's not the government's business to try to
  protect people from themselves.
\item
  \textbf{K\_SHARM} Sometimes the government needs to make laws that
  keep people from hurting themselves.
\item
  \textbf{K\_SLIMCHOI} The government should put limits on the choices
  individuals can make so they don't get in the way of what's good for
  society.
\item
  \textbf{K\_SPROTECT} The government should do more to advance
  society's goals, even if that means limiting the freedom and choices
  of individuals.
\end{itemize}

Hierarchy -Egalitarianism

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{K\_HEQUAL} We have gone too far in pushing equal rights in
  this country.
\item
  \textbf{K\_HREVDIS1} Nowadays it seems like there is just as much
  discrimination against upper castes as there is against Dalits.
\item
  \textbf{K\_EDISCRIM} Discrimination against minorities is still a very
  serious problem in our society.
\item
  \textbf{K\_ERADEQ1} We need to dramatically reduce inequalities
  between the rich and the poor.
\item
  \textbf{K\_EWEALTH} Our society would be better off if the
  distribution of wealth was more equal.
\item
  \textbf{K\_ERADEQ2} We need to dramatically reduce inequalities
  between men and women.
\end{itemize}

KahanI weak alpha = 0.29, KahanS strong alpha = 0.71 Hierarchy
-Egalitarianism strong alpha = 0.71 reasons for this could be that the
individualism items are not well adapted to the Indian population final
items alpha = 0.75

Four Factor Solution -

\textbf{MR1 Problems of industrialisation}

MECHANISATION- Rapid mechanization of work is taking away jobs from
workers in this country

OWNERREG- Regardless of ownership, the government should pass strong
regulations and implement them.

WEALTHLIM- A limit should be put to how much wealth a person can amass

\textbf{MR3 Local Economy And Decision Making}

INDUSTRYSMALL- Large corporations are destroying the local industries in
India and benefiting only a handful of people

ECONOMYLOCAL- India would be better off if foreign companies didn't come
to here

DECISIONDECEN- Local politicians shouldn't have to ask permission from
the central government to implement policies

\textbf{MR4 Centralised and Large Industry}

DECISIONCEN- Laws and policies would be implemented more smoothly if
more power lay with the central government

ECONOMYGLOBAL- Foreign companies have led to a range of benefits for the
Indian people and society

OWNERNOREG- There is too much red-tape and the government should not
interfere with businesses and industries

INDUSTRYLARGE- Large scale industries are required for the development
of the country that will benefit everyone

\textbf{MR2 Development and Business Ownership}

DEVOVERENV- Economic growth and creating jobs should be prioritized over
environmental protection

OWNERPVT- All businesses and industries should be owned privately

OWNERPUB- The government should own most large businesses and industries

ENVOVERDEV- Polluting industries that spoil the environment should be
shut down even if it costs people their jobs

Energy}\label{factor-analysis-on-scale-2---eco-pol-characteristics-of-the-technology---nuclear-energy}}

Two Factor Solution - positive versus negative characteristics

\textbf{MR1 Negative Characteristics}

HEALTHNUCLEAR - Nuclear energy poses a great risk to the health of
people living around it.

BEAUTYNUCLEAR - Nuclear energy spoils the natural beauty of the
landscape.

DISPLACENUCLEAR- Nuclear energy is leading to displacement of people
from their land.

POLLUTENUCLEAR- Nuclear energy increases pollution of air/water/land.

\textbf{MR2 Positive Characteristics}

DEVNUCLEAR- Nuclear energy pushes forward the country's development.

PRIDENUCLEAR- I would be proud if my community used nuclear energy.

NPRIDENUCLEAR- Nuclear energy is a mark of pride for our nation.

PROSPERNUCLEAR- Nuclear energy brings economic prosperity to the
surrounding regions.

JOBSNUCLEAR- Nuclear energy will bring jobs to the local community.

RELYNUCLEAR- I don't like the idea that I have to rely on the government
for electricity from nuclear energy.
